> Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.\[1\] The architecture of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building.\[2\] It functions as a blueprint for the system and the developing project, laying out the tasks necessary to be executed by the design teams.\[3\]

> Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices that are costly to change once implemented. Software architecture choices include specific structural options from possibilities in the design of the software. For example, the systems that controlled the Space Shuttle launch vehicle had the requirement of being very fast and very reliable. Therefore, an appropriate real-time computing language would need to be chosen. Additionally, to satisfy the need for reliability the choice could be made to have multiple redundant and independently produced copies of the program, and to run these copies on independent hardware while cross-checking results.

> 软件架构是关于做出基本的结构选择，一旦实现，更改这些选择的代价是昂贵的。软件架构选择包括软件设计中可能的特定结构选项。例如，控制航天飞机运载火箭的系统要求非常快和非常可靠。因此，需要选择一种合适的实时计算语言。此外，为了满足可靠性的需要，可以选择使用多个冗余的、独立生成的程序副本，并在交叉检查结果时在独立的硬件上运行这些副本。
